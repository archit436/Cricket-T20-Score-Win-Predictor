**1. Introduction**

Watching the T20 Cricket World Cup in 2024, I noticed that projected scores and win percentages were flashed sporadically across the scoreboard throughout the match. This gave me the idea to design my own tool that functions on-demand to provide the match viewers with a data-backed projection of the current state of the match and where it is headed. A cricket game, as is the case in any sport, has an immense number of factors that can affect the outcome of a match and our human minds can only remember and make computations within certain bounds. This tool deployed as a WebApp aims to solve that.

The WebApp can be accessed here: https://cricket-t20-score-predictor.streamlit.app/. The application takes in data input from the user, and depending on the innings of the match, outputs a projected score or win percentage. The computations are handled by** two separately trained and tuned Regression and Classification models**. The dataset used for the training of these models can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/cricsheet-a-retrosheet-for-cricket. Additionally, some of the design choices have been inspired by the work of @campusx-official.
