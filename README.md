**1. Introduction**

The outcome of a cricket game, like in many other sports, is impacted by an immense number of factors. This means that the best chance of predicting the state of a match and where it is headed is by using a data-backed approach. And that is the motivation behind this project. I have trained and tuned a Regression and Classification Model on match data of 1,400 cricket matches of the T20 format, to predict, depending on the innings of the game, the projected score or the win probability percentages for that game.
